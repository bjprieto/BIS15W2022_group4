We chose to focus on conducting analyses based on epidemiological data, namely New York City HIV/AIDS data from 2011-2015 to observe how HIV and AIDS have impacted the NYC population over time [1]. After cleaning up the data for our individual analyses, we found that in general, HIV and AIDS diagnoses, as well as HIV-related death have significantly declined across the NYC population from 2011-2015. Separate analyses also found how HIV/AIDS affected particular demographics, i.e. age group, race, and gender per borough. Additional data cleaning and analyses were done to compare the calculated proportions across demographic groups to those of the actual NYC population to identify true disproportionately affected groups [2]. Analyses largely consisted of `group_by()` and `summarize()` commands, and they were visualized via `ggplot()` for ease of interpretation.
